<p>Welcome to the Splunk Essentials for the Financial Services Industries app! In this app, we have provided <b id="analyticCount">340</b> different examples of how Splunk can be used to deliver application analytics, FSI compliance and detect fraud. Splunk is more than just a platform for IT and Security. It is hoped that these examples will show you the capabilities of Splunk within the Finanical Services Industry. Since Splunk collects and indexes machine data in near real-time, most of the reports shown here can be run in near real-time providing you with a business advantage over other solutions. Because the analytics, fraud, and compliance departments at most institutions are different units, we have separated the examples here into their separate respective use cases to reflect that alignment.</p>
<p>What’s an example, you ask? An example is a fully-usable piece of application log, metrics or telemetry content using Splunk’s capabilities. They can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with others, and in Splunk Enterprise (core) or with Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI), if it is a KPI metric. We also map these into four stages that represent the Splunk Financial Services Industry Journey.</p>
<p>Each example provides insight on how this can be applied in your environment, how it works, the difficulty level and what data can be valuable..  After reveiwing the examples, you are encouraged to use the SPL for your use cases</p>
<p>We recommend you start by determining which of the four stages best represents your level of depth and breadth with Splunk. The filters allow you to hone in on precisely the use cases, areas, that are applicable. And in case you forget, each page has a tour in the upper right that will walk you through all of the functionality!</p> </td>
