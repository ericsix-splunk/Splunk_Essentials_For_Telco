        <h3>How Does This Detection Work?</h3>
        <p>This method of anomaly detection builds an individual per-entity baseline by using daily values and then creating an average and a standard deviation. If the most recent value is more than X standard deviations away from the average, then it's anomalous. This is the cornerstone of many of the Security Data Science tools on the market (though not Splunk UBA) that you can get easily with Splunk Enterprise. </p>

        <h3>What Is Standard Deviation?</h3>
        
          <p>Standard deviation (aka stdev() in Splunk) is a measure of the variance for a series of numbers. For example:<br />
        <ul>  <li>One file is opened on 100, 123, 79, and 145 hosts per day
            <ul><li>Average of 111.75 and a standard deviation of 28.53</li></ul></li>
            <li>Another file is opened on 100, 342, 3 and 2 hosts per day
              <ul><li>Average of 111.75, but a standard deviation of 160.23</li></ul></li>
          <li>If on the final day, both files are opened on 500 hosts, the second file will only be 2.42 standard deviations away from normal (the average), but the first file will be 13.6 standard deviations away. WAY more deviation!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </td><td>
         <h3>How Much Deviation Is Too Much?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The number of stdevs away from the average (in the example just discussed, 13.6 or 2.42), also known as the z-score, is how you describe how much variation you're willing to tolerate.</li>
          <li>If your data set looked like a perfect bell curve (remember those?), one (1) stdev away from the average would encompass 68% of the data points, two (2) stdev would cover 95% of the data points, and three (3) stdev would cover 99.7%</li>
          <li>Your data probably doesn't look like a perfect bell curve, but in practice it's just as easy to filter for four (4) stdev, or five (5), or six (6) and isolate any noise in your data. So play with the numbers and see how they look.</li>
            
        </ul>

For example, if we have data points 10, 11, 9, 10, 10000, we want our average to be 10 and stdev 0.8 so that we can say 10,000 is 12.5k standard deviations away from the average (crazy abberant!). If we included that last value, the avg would be 2008, stdev, 4.5k, and our unusual value would be a scant 1.7 stdevs away from the average. (Go try it on a standard deviation calculation site, if you're not sure.) When we run over normal streaming data, we really are looking at data from the last day, so we can use the eval now() function to figure out what right now is. However, if we're running against older data such as our demo data, we need to calculate the latest time. That's a long way of saying that basically you need this checkbox if you're using demo data, and otherwise you can ignore it.">(?)</a></label>
