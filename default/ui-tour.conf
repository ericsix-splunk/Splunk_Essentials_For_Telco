imageCaption1 = This is the search assistant for normal Splunk searches. In this app, you will also find search assistants that help shortcut difficult search concepts, but for this one we're just using normal Splunk search.

imageCaption2 = We've tried to provide as much context as possible, so you can understand the impact of an example, how it works, adapt it to the particulars of your environment, and to handle the alerts that will be sent afterward.

imageCaption3 = In the boxes at the top, you can find high-level details, including the ever-important 'Data Source'. 

imageCaption4 = Beneath the boxes there's other contextual data, including how to implement and respond, as well as, other examples and related Splunk capabilities!

imageCaption5 = The default shows the types of results you will see from a search. If you want to get more techie, use the "Show Search" to see or help implement the search string. You can either view the line-by-line search documentation or turn on "Advanced SPL Mode" to always see all the detail. (Don't worry, we'll save that setting.)

imageCaption6 = One last item for the overview, in the upper right-hand corner is a list of what searches are available for each example. Often, there's just a demo version, which is the sample data, but some examples might have a live version in the future.

imageCaption1 = This is the search assistant for 'First Time Seen' searches. The search language for detecting the first time something happened is tricky, so we packaged all the logic into this dashboard. All that's left is the easy part.

imageCaption6 = To show what we mean when we described that this search automates the 'hard part' of detecting first time seen anomalies, we've highlighted the part of a search that we provided for a particular example, and the part that the dashboard provides. Much easier, right?
imageCaption7 = If you're in Advanced SPL mode, you will also be able to see the pre-requisite checks that make sure you have the right data onboard, you'll get the "Open in Search" buttons, and you'll even be able to click "Schedule Alert" to save this search right from the app.
imageCaption8 = One last item for the overview, up in the upper right-hand corner you can see we have a list of what searches are available for this example. Often, we just have a demo and a live version, but for some we might have three or four different versions.
