imageCaption2 = We've tried to provide as much context as possible, so you can understand the impact of an example, how it works, adapt it to the particulars of your environment, and to handle the alerts that will be sent afterward.

imageCaption3 = In the boxes at the top, you can find high-level details, including the ever-important 'Data Source'. 

imageCaption4 = Beneath the boxes there's other contextual data, including how to implement and respond, as well as, other examples and related Splunk capabilities!

imageCaption5 = The default shows the types of results you will see from a search. If you want to get more techie, use the "Show Search" to see or help implement the search string.

imageCaption1 = This is the search assistant for 'First Time Seen' searches. The search language for detecting the first time something happened is tricky, so we packaged all the logic into this dashboard. All that's left is the easy part.
